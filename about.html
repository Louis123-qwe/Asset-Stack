                As a Web Developer and Marketing Strategist, I analyze systems for efficiency. In my career, I've noticed that most professionals treat their tools as <strong>expenses</strong>, when they should be treating them as <strong>assets</strong>.

            <p>
                <strong>Asset Stack</strong> is a curated hub for high-ROI equipment and financial tools that move the needle for growing businesses and high-performance individuals.

            <p>
                Every asset listed here undergoes a three-point audit:
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Utility:</strong> Does it solve a specific professional bottleneck?</li>
                    <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Is this a long-term asset or a temporary trend?</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost-Efficiency:</strong> Does the output justify the investment?</li>
                </ul>
